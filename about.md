I am a nerdy senior in Ronald Reagan High School in San Antonio, Texas, who grew up playing videogames and playing with superhero action figures, who has the dream and the ambition to help as much people as possible. I am the type of guy that likes to help, from a simple physics question, to several hour tutorings in Spanish and Japanese or math.
