Below are some of my projects

The Interactive Club Kiosk(ICK) is a kiosk that controlls an interactive sculpure placed on the school. The sculpture gives every club and organization an oportunity to express themselves in their own unique way. The orchestra and band sections have conducting paint that when pressed play music created by the students. The art organizations like the animation club and the art honor society have their own sections where they can show some of their talents and allow students to interact with them. Just like these few clubs, many more of the school's clubs will have their own sections where they can express themselves. The sculpture is managed by the robotics club where the students are divided into groups and are assigned to help out specific clubs. The groups include experienced upperclassmen and new passionate underclassmen. The reason for this is not only to help clubs with any technology involved in their section, but to create a mentorship system where the seniors and juniors can leave a legacy in the school.

I created the Japanese Club for the purpose of preparing students for the AP exam, but more than that, it is there to spread the knowledge of the beautiful Japanese Culture. The club is a gateway for Japanese language students to practice their Japanese, learn traditional Japanese arts and costoms, and interact with Japanese students.
